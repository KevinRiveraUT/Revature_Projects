## Revature Projects

Welcome to my branch of 1804_apr_jts.
Here you'll find the projects and assignments I've worked on while training with Revature.

## Assignment Week 1

This assignment covered most of the basics of Java through a series of problems that increased gradually in difficulty while also covering different topics.

## bankaccount (AKA Project 0)

This project was mostly about setting up a Oracle DB with Amazon's AWS platform. Then creating a Java application to access data from the DB using a DAO (Data Access Object) pattern. The main application runs in the console and takes user input for menu selections as well as the other features.

## ERS (AKA Project 1)

This project is about Reimbursment System. The project requires a client side, middleware, and server side. The web application has a login screen where a manager or a user can login. 
Once in the homepage, a user can update their information, create a reiumbursment ticket, and view their pending and resolved requests.
When a manager logs in, he can view his information, view all resolved requests, view all pending requests, view all requests made by a single employee
